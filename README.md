Spelunky like procedural Generation in Godot 3.4

You can change the amount of rows and colums, as well as the room size as you want and adding new rooms, is as simple as duplicating an already existing one and changing the TileMap. Implementing rooms like shops or snakepits is also pretty easy (see source code).

It's probably not the best or compact solution but it works really reliable and it's easy to add a player or anything else you want.

Here you can find the commented source Code : https://github.com/YukkiTimmy/SpelunkyLikeGeneration

Use it as your heart's content!
